- **Path Traversal Protection**: Prevents `../` attacks during archive extraction
- **Rollback Protection**: Epoch-based versioning blocks downgrade attacks
- **Multi-Key Rotation**: Support for trusted key rotation and management

### Catalog Management
- **Versioned Manifest**: Signed `manifest.json` with epoch and client version requirements
- **Dual Format Support**: Both `.tar.zst` (primary) and `.tar.gz` (fallback) database formats
- **Safe Extraction**: Protected tar extraction with comprehensive validation
- **Automated Updates**: Ready-to-use scheduler templates for all platforms

### CLI Enhancements
- **New Commands**:
  - `quietpatch catalog-update` - Update vulnerability catalog with rollback protection
  - `quietpatch db-apply <archive> <signature>` - Verify and extract database archives
  - `quietpatch trust list/add/remove` - Manage trusted signing keys
  - `quietpatch verify <report>` - Verify HTML report integrity
  - `quietpatch diagnostics` - Generate support bundle for troubleshooting

### Security Gates & Testing
- **Hard Release Gates**: Comprehensive testing catches security regressions
- **Deterministic Reports**: Fixed timestamps and content hashing for reproducibility
- **Mock Scanning**: Fast, deterministic CI checks with `--mock` flag
- **Platform-Specific Constraints**: Hermetic installations work across all platforms

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements

### Platform Support
- **macOS**: Native ARM64 support with proper PEX handling
- **Linux**: Full glibc/musl compatibility with platform-specific dependencies
- **Windows**: PowerShell integration and Windows Store Python support

### Installation & Distribution

- **Docker Support**: Official container image with offline-first design
- **Hermetic Builds**: Platform-specific constraint files ensure reproducible installs

### Documentation & Support
- **Security Policies**: Clear documentation of all security guarantees
- **Support Matrix**: Comprehensive compatibility and requirement documentation
- **Issue Templates**: Structured templates for bug reports and feature requests
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Step-by-step solutions for common issues

## üîß Breaking Changes

- **Python Version**: Now requires Python 3.11+ (previously 3.9+)
- **CLI Changes**: New subcommands for catalog and trust management
- **Database Format**: New epoch-based versioning system

## üì¶ Installation

### Quick Install
```bash
